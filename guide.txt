find shortest path
one by one, remove each edge used by the shortest path from the dataset and calculate the shortest route from the spur point to the end
save each path in an array possiblePaths
whichever of those is the shortest is the second shortest path
repeat the same process with the second shortest path, putting all the possible paths generated in that same array possiblePaths
whatever is the shortest is the third shortest path
and so on
